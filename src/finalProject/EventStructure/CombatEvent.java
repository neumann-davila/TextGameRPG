/*
 *								---Combat System---
 *
 * The combat system is going to have multiple steps in its entirety
 * This will be a turn based combat system with the ability to react to current actions
 * The main idea is to create a strategy like combat system similar to pokemon
 *
 *  Questions to answer before starting:
 *
 * 		- Where should the method be located?
 *              - There will be individual combatMethods for NPC's and Player's
 *                  - !This would not work as I need to pass the instance of the NPC!
 *                      !From itself to the player which is not possible!
 *              - Create a CombatEvent class that will run everything for you once created
 *                  - Thie can contain methods that are for all cases in an organized way
 *
 * 		- Should NPC's be able to fight each other?
 *              - NPC combat is something that I plan to add but for now this system is what I need to work on
 *
 * 1.) Combat starts on the player's turn:
 * 		During this turn the player will have 4 main options
 * 			- Open inventory
 * 				- Use consumable items
 * 				- Equip other Items
 * 			- Attack with equipped weapon
 * 			- Use surroundings (TBD)
 * 				- in any location there will be random event that can
 * 					run based of stat rolls
 * 			- Run
 * 				- Dexterity rol that determines the ability to escape
 *		All of these actions will use an entire turn to run
 *
 * 2.) If an attack is made the enemy will have a chance to react
 * 			- Counter Attack
 * 				- only possible if reacting from a melee weapon
 * 				- runs as a normal attack would
 * 				- half Damage
 * 			- Dodge
 * 				- since Blocking damage is passively done with attacks this will need to be unique
 *				- Potentially a dex roll to see if you can dodge all damage
 *
 * 3.) Combat Cycle continues but now it is the NPC turn
 *		Some type of AI ay need to be made to decide the actions of mor complex NPC
 *
 * 4.)  Player will have a chance to react similarly to the NPC
