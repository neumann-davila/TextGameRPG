 *
 * This is the structure for Choices. These choices contain an interface object with a runnable
 * abstract method. This is so I can create and run a new method easily and with every iteration of
 * a Choice. This also includes a Choice description, which is displayed when initially in the Event,
 * and an outcome description, which is optional and is displayed while the choice is running.
